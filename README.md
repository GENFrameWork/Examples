## Examples 

The GEN FrameWork examples are a set of projects to test the different framework functionalities. They are divided into 3 blocks:

- **Base**, They are basic examples, with the minimum overload and dependencies of the framework. They are for use in environments with minimal resources (eg a microcontroller).
- **Console**, They are examples with console output, valid for the backend functionality of the framework.
- **Graphics**, Examples that make use of the graphic capabilities of the framework.


## Base examples
- **NoApp**, Minimum application: using the minimum dependencies of the framework.
- **Canvas2DDisplay** Minimum application for graphics on displays/LCDs.


## Console examples

- **BinConnPro**, How to use the generic binary protocol, automatic connection management, with encryption level.
- **Databases**, Example of the use of the framework database connector (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, ...).
- **MiniWebServer**, Example of using the internal Web server with API-Rest, WebSocket and Plugings management: CGI.
- **Scripts**, Example of use of the possible Scripts that it manages of the FrameWork: GEN Script, Lua & JavaScript.

## Graphics examples

- **Canvas2D**, Graphic example in 2D, with support of Bitmaps, Viewports, Sprites, etc ...
- **UI_Options**, User Interface example.
